# Web3

Web3 is a new evolution of the Internet based around the principles of decentralization. Web3 combines the rich and interactive digital experiences that exist today with infrastructure that offers users ownership and cryptographic guarantees.

### Web 1 vs Web 2 vs Web 3

#### Web 1.0 (Static Web):

- Timeframe: Late 1990s to early 2000s.
- Characteristics: Static web pages with limited interactivity.
- Key Features: Basic HTML websites, one-way communication, read-only content.
- Usage: Information dissemination, online brochures, early websites.

#### Web 2.0 (Social Web):

- Timeframe: Mid-2000s to mid-2010s.
- Characteristics: Dynamic and interactive web with user-generated content.
- Key Features: Social media, user-generated content, collaboration, web apps.
- Usage: Social networking, content sharing, online collaboration, e-commerce.

#### Web 3.0 (Semantic Web, Decentralized Web):

- Timeframe: Emerging since the mid-2010s and ongoing.
- Characteristics: Decentralization, blockchain technology, AI-driven, semantic understanding.
- Key Features: Decentralized applications (DApps), blockchain, smart contracts, AI-driven services, enhanced data interoperability.
- Usage: Decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), self-sovereign identity, enhanced privacy, and data ownership

## Core Elements of Web3

**Blockchains:** 
A blockchain is a highly secure and decentralized network that allows people to store data, exchange value, and record transaction activity in a shared ledger that is not controlled by any central authority. Blockchain networks serve as the backbone of Web3, providing secure execution environments that allow for the creation, distribution, and trading of cryptocurrencies, as well as the development of programmable smart contracts. Blockchains are the settlement layer of Web3.

**Cryptocurrency:** 
Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that leverage the decentralized and tamper-proof environments of blockchain networks to facilitate highly secure transactions. They are the native currencies of Web3 decentralized applications (dApps) and can also be used to pay for Web3 services and participate in Web3 governance. 


Tokens in Web3 applications are also units of value issued to Web3 content creators, but these units of value are digital, programmable, and have functions beyond exchange. In Web3, a token might be held as an investment in a protocol, project, or blockchain. It might have utility for that project or protocol—for paying for a service or insuring a service, for example. It might also provide a gateway to participation in the governance of the protocol or project.

**Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps):** 
Smart contracts are tamper-proof programs on blockchains that facilitate automatic transactions by using conditional software logic such as, “if x is true, then execute y.” Programmable smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications, or dApps, the cryptoeconomic protocols that bring Web3 to life and put it in the hands of users.

dApps are different from the applications (apps) that we are familiar with in the Web 2.0 world and the static HTML pages from the Web 1.0 world because they are not maintained by any single individual or organization but rather powered by the decentralized infrastructure of blockchain networks. These seemingly simple, decentralized programs can be used to create complex, automated systems such as peer-to-peer financial services (DeFi), data-driven insurance products, play-to-earn online games, and more.

**Oracles**
To realize their full potential, smart contracts need to access and interact with data and systems outside of blockchain networks. Oracles are the entities that connect blockchains to real-world data and existing systems, and provide critical infrastructure for establishing a unified, interoperable Web3 ecosystem.

Chainlink oracle networks not only feed financial market data on-chain to power DeFi applications, but they also provide a wide range of secure off-chain computations such as verifiable randomness and decentralized execution to enable dynamic NFTs and highly automated dApps. Moreover, with the development of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), oracle networks will help enable the fast-growing ecosystem of different blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions to securely communicate with one another.
