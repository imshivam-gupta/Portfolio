A blockchain is "a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks." These blocks â€œare linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.





# Bitcoin Protocol

The Bitcoin white paper, authored by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, introduced a decentralized digital currency system based on blockchain technology. It proposed a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, enabling secure and transparent transactions between individuals across the internet. This innovation laid the foundation for the cryptocurrency ecosystem we know today.

The Bitcoin white paper introduced several key ideas:

1. **Decentralization**: It proposed a decentralized network where no single entity or authority controls the currency. Instead, it relies on a distributed ledger called the blockchain.
2. **Blockchain Technology**: The white paper introduced the concept of the blockchain, a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions in a secure and chronological manner.
3. **Proof-of-Work**: Bitcoin's white paper described the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which miners use to validate and add transactions to the blockchain, incentivizing network security.
4. **Digital Scarcity**: It introduced the idea of a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins, creating digital scarcity and potentially store of value characteristics.
5. **Peer-to-Peer Transactions**: Bitcoin was designed for peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks and enabling direct transfers between users.
6. **Security**: The white paper emphasized cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new Bitcoins.
7. **Ownership Control**: It allowed users to have full control over their private keys, providing ownership and control over their Bitcoin holdings.


# Ethereum Protocol

Ethereum was introduced in 2015 as a significant advancement in blockchain technology following the creation of Bitcoin. It brought several key changes and innovations to the cryptocurrency landscape:

1. **Smart Contracts:** Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, Smart Contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decrentralized way without the need for centralized or third party intermediary.
2. **Turing-Complete Programming:** Unlike Bitcoin's scripting language, Ethereum's programming language is Turing-complete. This means developers can create complex and customizable applications on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.
3. **Gas Fees:** Ethereum introduced the concept of "gas" to determine transaction fees. Gas represents the computational power required to process a transaction or smart contract. Users must pay gas fees to incentivize miners to include their transactions in blocks.
4. **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** The Ethereum network operates on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a runtime environment that executes smart contracts. This allows for code execution on a distributed network of computers, ensuring decentralization and security.
5. **Ether (ETH):** While Bitcoin introduced a digital currency, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency is called Ether (ETH). Ether serves multiple purposes within the Ethereum ecosystem, including paying transaction fees and as collateral for various DeFi applications.
6. **Constant Innovation:** Ethereum follows a regular upgrade cycle, with hard forks introducing new features and improvements. For example, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade aims to transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to improve scalability and energy efficiency.
7. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFTs:** Ethereum's flexibility and smart contract capabilities have led to the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which offer various financial services without traditional intermediaries. Additionally, Ethereum is the primary platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent ownership of unique digital assets.
