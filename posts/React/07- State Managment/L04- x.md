Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

Redux helps you manage "global" state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.
The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why, and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application logic will behave when those changes occur. Redux guides you towards writing code that is predictable and testable, which helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.


Redux Libraries and Tools
Redux is a small standalone JS library. However, it is commonly used with several other packages:

React-Redux
Redux can integrate with any UI framework, and is most frequently used with React. React-Redux is our official package that lets your React components interact with a Redux store by reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the store.

Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is our recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

Redux DevTools Extension
The Redux DevTools Extension shows a history of the changes to the state in your Redux store over time. This allows you to debug your applications effectively, including using powerful techniques like "time-travel debugging".



Example - 

```js
function Counter() {
  // State: a counter value
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  // Action: code that causes an update to the state when something happens
  const increment = () => {
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
  }

  // View: the UI definition
  return (
    <div>
      Value: {counter} <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

t is a self-contained app with the following parts:

The state, the source of truth that drives our app;
The view, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state
The actions, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state
This is a small example of "one-way data flow":

State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
The UI is rendered based on that state
When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred
The UI re-renders based on the new state

However, the simplicity can break down when we have multiple components that need to share and use the same state, especially if those components are located in different parts of the application. Sometimes this can be solved by "lifting state up" to parent components, but that doesn't always help.

One way to solve this is to extract the shared state from the components, and put it into a centralized location outside the component tree. With this, our component tree becomes a big "view", and any component can access the state or trigger actions, no matter where they are in the tree!

By defining and separating the concepts involved in state management and enforcing rules that maintain independence between views and states, we give our code more structure and maintainability.

This is the basic idea behind Redux: a single centralized place to contain the global state in your application, and specific patterns to follow when updating that state to make the code predictable.



#### Immutability
"Mutable" means "changeable". If something is "immutable", it can never be changed.

JavaScript objects and arrays are all mutable by default. If I create an object, I can change the contents of its fields. 
In order to update values immutably, your code must make copies of existing objects/arrays, and then modify the copies.

We can do this by hand using JavaScript's array / object spread operators, as well as array methods that return new copies of the array instead of mutating the original array:

```js
const obj = {
  a: {
    // To safely update obj.a.c, we have to copy each piece
    c: 3
  },
  b: 2
}

const obj2 = {
  // copy obj
  ...obj,
  // overwrite a
  a: {
    // copy obj.a
    ...obj.a,
    // overwrite c
    c: 42
  }
}

const arr = ['a', 'b']
// Create a new copy of arr, with "c" appended to the end
const arr2 = arr.concat('c')

// or, we can make a copy of the original array:
const arr3 = arr.slice()
// and mutate the copy:
arr3.push('c')
```

#### Actions

An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field. You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application. The type field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name, like "todos/todoAdded". We usually write that type string like "domain/eventName", where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to, and the second part is the specific thing that happened. An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called payload.

A typical action object might look like this:

```js
{
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}
```

#### Action  Creators

An action creator is a function that creates and returns an action object. We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:

```js
const addTodo = text => {
  return {
    type: 'todos/todoAdded',
    payload: text
  }
}
```

#### Reducers

A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: (state, action) => newState. You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type. Reducer" functions get their name because they're similar to the kind of callback function you pass to the array. reduce() method.

Reducers must always follow some specific rules:

They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments
They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.
They must not do any asynchronous logic, calculate random values, or cause other "side effects"


The logic inside reducer functions typically follows the same series of steps:

Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
If so, make a copy of the state, update the copy with new values, and return it
Otherwise, return the existing state unchanged

```js
const initialState = { value: 0 }

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
  if (action.type === 'counter/increment') {
    // If so, make a copy of `state`
    return {
      ...state,
      // and update the copy with the new value
      value: state.value + 1
    }
  }
  // otherwise return the existing state unchanged
  return state
}
```


#### Store

The current Redux application state lives in an object called the store .
The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called getState that returns the current state value 

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer })

console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 0}
```


#### Dispatch

Dispatch
The Redux store has a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object. The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside, and we can call getState() to retrieve the updated value:

```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/increment' })
console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 1}
```

You can think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event" in the application. Something happened, and we want the store to know about it. Reducers act like event listeners, and when they hear an action they are interested in, they update the state in response.

#### Selectors

Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data:

```js
const selectCounterValue = state => state.value
const currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState())
console.log(currentValue)
// 1
```


Workflows

Initial setup:
A Redux store is created using a root reducer function
The store calls the root reducer once, and saves the return value as its initial state
When the UI is first rendered, UI components access the current state of the Redux store, and use that data to decide what to render. They also subscribe to any future store updates so they can know if the state has changed.
Updates:
Something happens in the app, such as a user clicking a button
The app code dispatches an action to the Redux store, like dispatch({type: 'counter/increment'})
The store runs the reducer function again with the previous state and the current action, and saves the return value as the new state
The store notifies all parts of the UI that are subscribed that the store has been updated
Each UI component that needs data from the store checks to see if the parts of the state they need have changed.
Each component that sees its data has changed forces a re-render with the new data, so it can update what's shown on the screen

all the logic in our application has been synchronous. Actions are dispatched, the store runs the reducers and calculates the new state, and the dispatch function finishes. But, the JavaScript language has many ways to write code that is asynchronous, and our apps normally have async logic for things like fetching data from an API. We need a place to put that async logic in our Redux apps.

A thunk is a specific kind of Redux function that can contain asynchronous logic. Thunks are written using two functions:

An inside thunk function, which gets dispatch and getState as arguments
The outside creator function, which creates and returns the thunk function
The next function that's exported from counterSlice is an example of a thunk action creator

```js
// The function below is called a thunk and allows us to perform async logic.
// It can be dispatched like a regular action: `dispatch(incrementAsync(10))`.
// This will call the thunk with the `dispatch` function as the first argument.
// Async code can then be executed and other actions can be dispatched
export const incrementAsync = amount => dispatch => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount))
  }, 1000)
}
```

```js
store.dispatch(incrementAsync(5))
```

However, using thunks requires that the redux-thunk middleware (a type of plugin for Redux) be added to the Redux store when it's created. Fortunately, Redux Toolkit's configureStore function already sets that up for us automatically, so we can go ahead and use thunks here.

When you need to make AJAX calls to fetch data from the server, you can put that call in a thunk. Here's an example that's written a bit longer, so you can see how it's defined:

![Image](https://redux.js.org/assets/images/ReduxAsyncDataFlowDiagram-d97ff38a0f4da0f327163170ccc13e80.gif)



etching Data with createAsyncThunk

Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk API generates thunks that automatically dispatch those "start/success/failure" actions for you.

Let's start by adding a thunk that will make an AJAX call to retrieve a list of posts. We'll import the client utility from the src/api folder, and use that to make a request to '/fakeApi/posts'.

```js
import { createSlice, nanoid, createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { client } from '../../api/client'

const initialState = {
  posts: [],
  status: 'idle',
  error: null
}

export const fetchPosts = createAsyncThunk('posts/fetchPosts', async () => {
  const response = await client.get('/fakeApi/posts')
  return response.data
})
```

createAsyncThunk accepts two arguments:

A string that will be used as the prefix for the generated action types
A "payload creator" callback function that should return a Promise containing some data, or a rejected Promise with an error

The payload creator will usually make an AJAX call of some kind, and can either return the Promise from the AJAX call directly, or extract some data from the API response and return that. We typically write this using the JS async/await syntax, which lets us write functions that use Promises while using standard try/catch logic instead of somePromise.then() chains.

The extraReducers option should be a function that receives a parameter called builder. The builder object provides methods that let us define additional case reducers that will run in response to actions defined outside of the slice. We'll use builder.addCase(actionCreator, reducer) to handle each of the actions dispatched by our async thunks.


In this case, we need to listen for the "pending" and "fulfilled" action types dispatched by our fetchPosts thunk. Those action creators are attached to our actual fetchPost function, and we can pass those to extraReducers to listen for those actions:

The builder object in extraReducers provides methods that let us define additional case reducers that will run in response to actions defined outside of the slice:

builder.addCase(actionCreator, reducer): defines a case reducer that handles a single known action type based on either an RTK action creator or a plain action type string
builder.addMatcher(matcher, reducer): defines a case reducer that can run in response to any action where the matcher function returns true
builder.addDefaultCase(reducer): defines a case reducer that will run if no other case reducers were executed for this action.
You can chain these together, like builder.addCase().addCase().addMatcher().addDefaultCase(). If multiple matchers match the action, they will run in the order they were defined.

```js
import { increment } from '../features/counter/counterSlice'

const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    // slice-specific reducers here
  },
  extraReducers: builder => {
    builder
      .addCase('counter/decrement', (state, action) => {})
      .addCase(increment, (state, action) => {})
  }
})
```








```js
export const fetchPosts = createAsyncThunk('posts/fetchPosts', async () => {
  const response = await client.get('/fakeApi/posts')
  return response.data
})

const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    // omit existing reducers here
  },
  extraReducers(builder) {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchPosts.pending, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'loading'
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'succeeded'
        // Add any fetched posts to the array
        state.posts = state.posts.concat(action.payload)
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'failed'
        state.error = action.error.message
      })
  }
})
```




ex

```js
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import { client } from '../../api/client'

export const fetchNotifications = createAsyncThunk(
  'notifications/fetchNotifications',
  async (_, { getState }) => {
    const allNotifications = selectAllNotifications(getState())
    const [latestNotification] = allNotifications
    const latestTimestamp = latestNotification ? latestNotification.date : ''
    const response = await client.get(
      `/fakeApi/notifications?since=${latestTimestamp}`
    )
    return response.data
  }
)

const notificationsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'notifications',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers(builder) {
    builder.addCase(fetchNotifications.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
      state.push(...action.payload)
      // Sort with newest first
      state.sort((a, b) => b.date.localeCompare(a.date))
    })
  }
})

export default notificationsSlice.reducer

export const selectAllNotifications = state => state.notifications
```
