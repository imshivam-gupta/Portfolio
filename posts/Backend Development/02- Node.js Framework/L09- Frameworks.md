Node frameworks are essential tools that facilitate the fast development of Node.js applications. They come with pre-built components like database management systems (DBMS), web servers, and templating engines that help developers create applications quickly. They also promote code organization by providing structures and conventions for writing modular code that can be used across different projects and teams within an organization.

## Express

Express.js is a framework for building web applications in Node.js. It provides a robust set of features that help you build web apps quickly and easily, including:

- Routing – Express provides an easy way to map URLs to functions within your application, allowing you to create complex routes for your users without having to worry about writing lots of boilerplate code.
- Middleware – Middleware is used by Express to process requests and responses before they reach your route handlers, which allows you to add functionality like authentication or logging without needing any special configuration from the user (or yourself).
- Plugins –  Plugins are third-party modules that extend Express’ functionality with additional features such as database support or templating engines (more on this later).

## Sails

Sails.js is an open-source web application framework built on top of Node.js and modeled using the server-side application framework Ruby on Rails. It is designed to simplify the development of custom, real-time applications. Sails.js is used to build RESTful APIs and web sockets. The framework follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern that allows developers to organize their application code into distinct components for easy maintenance.

One of the primary advantages of Sails.js is its built-in support for web sockets, which allows for real-time data updates without requiring a page refresh. This feature makes it ideal for building real-time applications. Sails.js also includes numerous pre-built features and plugins, such as authentication, sessions, and security, that help to accelerate the development process, allowing developers to build applications quickly and efficiently.

## Nest.js 

Nest.js is a server-side application framework that runs on Node.js. It’s built using Typescript. It is highly scalable and testable. The key advantage of using Nest.js is its modular architecture, which enables developers to organize their code into reusable modules. This approach simplifies code maintenance and testing, and it promotes code reusability across different projects.

With the help of Nest.Js, APIs and Model View Controller(MVC) applications can be created. Nest.js is used to develop scalable and light weighted monoliths and microservices. Nest.js has many pre-built modules and features like authentication, database management, logging, caching, etc. This reduces development time and effort, as developers don’t have to create these features from scratch. Nest.js is anytime a good choice for application development.
