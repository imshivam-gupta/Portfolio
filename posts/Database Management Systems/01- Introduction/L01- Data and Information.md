## Data and Information

##### Data
Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc. In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself. Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing. Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed. It is of 2 types -
- Quantitative - Numerical form. Example - Weight, Volume, cost of an item
- Qualitative - Descriptive form. Example - Name, Gender, Hair Color of a person


##### Information
Information is processed, organized, and structured data. It provides context of the data and enables decision making. Information is extracted from the data, by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data. For example - we have data of all the people living in your locality, its Data, when we analyze and interpret the data and come to some conclusion that: 
- There are 100 senior citizens. 
- The sex ratio is 1:1. 
- Newborn babies are 100.
