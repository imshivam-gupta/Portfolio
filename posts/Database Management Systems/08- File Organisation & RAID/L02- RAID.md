Relational Model (RM) organises the data in the form of relations (tables). A relational DB consists of collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values, and table is collection of such relationships.
Terminology - 
	• Row: An element t of r is a tuple, represented by a row in a table
	• Column: Columns represents the attributes of the relation. Each attribute, there is a permitted value, called domain of the attribute. Attribute values are (normally) required to be atomic, that is, indivisible. Multivalued and composite attribute values are not atomic. The special value null is a member of every domain
	• Relation Schema: defines the design and structure of the relation, contains the name of the relation and all the columns/attributes.
	• Degree of table: number of attributes/columns in a given table/relation. 
	• Cardinality: Total no. of tuples in a given relation.
	• Relational Key: Set of attributes which can uniquely identify an each tuple.
