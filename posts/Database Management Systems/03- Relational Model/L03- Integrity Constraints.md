Integrity constraints are a set of rules. These are used to maintain the quality of information. Integrity constraints ensure that the data insertion, updating, and other processes have to be performed in such a way that data integrity is not affected. Thus, integrity constraint is used to guard against accidental damage to the database


### The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
- UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
- PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
- FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
- CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
- DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
- CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly


### Types of Integrity Constraint â€“

1. **Domain constraints -** Domain constraints can be defined as the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. The data type of domain includes string, character, integer, time, date, currency, etc. The value of the attribute must be available in the corresponding domain. We can also test by check clause. Examples -

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255),
    CONSTRAINT CHK_Person CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes')
);
```


2. **Referential Integrity Constraints -** A referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables. In the Referential integrity constraints, if a foreign key in Table 1 refers to the Primary Key of Table 2, then every value of the Foreign Key in Table 1 must be null or be available in Table 2. Example -

/>

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
```



3. **Entity integrity constraints -** The entity integrity constraint states that primary key value can't be null. This is because the primary key value is used to identify individual rows in relation and if the primary key has a null value, then we can't identify those rows. A table can contain a null value other than the primary key field. Example 

<img

    alt="Entity integrity constraints"
/>

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);

```





4. **Key constraints -** Keys are the entity set that is used to identify an entity within its entity set uniquely. An entity set can have multiple keys, but out of which one key will be the primary key. A primary key can only contain a unique value in the relational table. Example -

    alt="Key constraints"
/>

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)
);
```
