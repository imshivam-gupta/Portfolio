Procedural programming is a programming language derived from structure programming and based on the concept of calling procedure. The procedures are the functions, routines, or subroutines that consist series of steps to be carried out in the C++ OOPs concept.



#### Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming

| Parameter	| Procedural Programming	| Object-Oriented Programming|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition	| In procedural programming, we break down a task into variables and routines. After that, it is carried out every step one by one. | In Object-Oriented Programming, a programming model is based upon the concepts of objects, or where everything is represented as an object. | 
| Security | 	Procedural programming is less secure than Object-Oriented Programming.| 	Object-Oriented Programming is secure because data hiding is possible in OOPs due to abstraction.| 
| Approach	| Procedural programming follow top-down approach| 	Object-Oriented Programming follow bottom-up approach| 
| Orientation	| Procedural programming is structure/procedure-oriented	| It is Object-oriented| 
| Access Modifiers| 	No access modifiers in Procedural programming.	| Private, Public, and Protected are the access modifiers in Object-Oriented Programming.| 
| Code Reusability	| No code reusability in Procedural programming.	| Due to Inheritance, the concept of code reusability exists in Object-Oriented Programming.| 
| Virtual Class| 	In Procedural programming, there is no concept of virtual classes.	| There exists a concept of virtual classes in Object-Oriented Programming.| 
| Overloading	| In procedural programming, overloading is not possible.| 	Object-Oriented Programming has a concept of function overloading and operator overloading.| 
| Program Division	| In Procedural programming, the program is divided into small functions.	| In Object-Oriented Programming, a program is divided into small objects.| 
| Examples| 	Examples of procedural programming are FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, and C.| 	Examples of object-oriented programming are Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, and Scala.|
