A package is a container for the classes that are used to keep the class name space compartmentalized. It is used to keep the classes and the interface in different packages according to their functionality. This helps in keeping the code clean and easy to understand.

Example: We can create all classes related to all sorting algorithms in a package named sorting and all classes related to searching algorithms in a package named searching.

It allows flexibility to give the same name but to many classes that is to avoid name space collision. Package is both naming and visibility control mechanism. It supports reusability and maintainability of the code.
