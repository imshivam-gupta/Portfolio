## Data Structure 

A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that it can be used efficiently. Here, we have used the word efficiently, which in terms of both the space and time. For example, a stack is an ADT (Abstract data type) which uses either arrays or linked list data structure for the implementation. Therefore, we conclude that we require some data structure to implement a particular ADT.

#### Classification of Data Structure:

**Linear data structure:** Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
- Static data structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. An example of this data structure is an array.
- Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.  Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.

**Non-linear data structure:** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only.  Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.

## Algorithms

A finite set of instruction that specifies a sequence of operation is to be carried out in order to solve a specific problem or class of problems is called an Algorithm. Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.

#### Need for Algorithm Analysis:

- To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.
- It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes.
- It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many influencing factors.
- The analysis is thus only an approximation; it is not perfect.
- More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.
